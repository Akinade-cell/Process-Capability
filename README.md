# Process-Capability
Process capability is a statistical measure used to evaluate how well a process can produce outputs that meet customer specifications. It compares the natural variation of a process (its spread and centering) to the allowable specification limits. Key indices—Cp, Cpk, Pp, and Ppk—quantify how capable and consistent a process is over time. A higher capability index indicates a stable, predictable process with minimal defects, while lower values signal the need for improvement. Process capability is essential in quality assurance, continuous improvement, and manufacturing to ensure products consistently meet quality standards.
